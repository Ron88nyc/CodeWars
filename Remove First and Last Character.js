It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. 
You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.




my solution with splice
function removeChar(str){
  return str.split('').splice(1,str.length-2).join('')
          
};


solution with slice
function removeChar(str) {
  return str.slice(1, -1);
}


const removeChar = str => str.slice(1,-1)
